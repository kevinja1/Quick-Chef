Welcome to Quick Chef, the simplest way to dinner!


Here is the link to my website:

How to use my website:

Once you click the link for the website, you will be directed to the home screen of quick chef! 
Here, you can immediately get started for a membership, or you can scroll down for more information about the company. 
You can read about what is included in the box, a preview of our menu, and some customer testimonials.

There are also countless images of our delicious food!

All the way to the bottom of the screen, you can check to see if Quick Chef is available in your area. 
Our target location is our local community but we plan to expand soon!

For zipcode testing (geographic availability), enter 07052, 07054, 07866, 07834, or 07960 for a zip code that we deliver to. These zipcodes correspond to my local community of 250,000 residents. 

You can also check out the "How it works" tab on the top of the site. Here, a video awaits you explaining Quick Chef.

Additionally, this page provides steps on how to use Quick Chef which is quick and easy!

For a quick, one-time checkout, you can go to the "Our Menu" tab on the top of the site.

Here, a whole plethora of food options await you. Categorized by food type (Asian, Italian, or Mexican) and Vegan, Meat, Semi-Vegetarian, Vegetarian, and Gluten-Free, these foods come with a description, time to prepare and calorie count. Of course, there is also a high quality image to show what the final dish will look like.

By clicking the add button, you can add the dish to the cart and go to the "Cart" tab.

Once you are at the "Cart" tab, you can checkout and fill out the checkout form and your order is set!

If you are looking for a membership-style option, you can click the "login" tab on the top of the screen. Here, you can sign up for an account or login with a previously made account. 

One example of an already made account is: username: jliew  password: admin

You can set your preferences such as Vegan and gluten free and low calorie and fill out the rest of your information. You can choose plans based on number of people needed to serve and number of servings needed per week.

If you sign up, you can login and then a new tab called "account" will appear on the top of the site. Here, you can see your preferences and account information.

Finally, in the footer of the website, you can read about delivery dates as well as contact us.
